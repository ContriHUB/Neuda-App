Neuda project is a Spring Boot-based banking system designed with a modular structure, ensuring maintainability and separation of concerns. It follows standard practices by organizing components into packages for models, repositories, services, controllers, and exceptions. The Account and Transaction entities are stored as MongoDB documents, with AccountRepository extending MongoRepository for data access. Business logic, such as creating accounts and processing transactions, resides in the AccountService class, while AccountController manages API requests. Custom exceptions like InsufficientFundsException and AccountNotFoundException enhance error handling, ensuring a smooth transaction flow.

Project Folder Structure and Classes
1. Project Structure Overview:
"Our project follows a standard Spring Boot structure. The main components are divided
into specific packages for better organization and maintainability."
1. Main Application Class
 Purpose: This is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
Explanation:
"The `BankingSystemApplication` class contains the `main` method which bootstraps the
Spring Boot application."
"It uses the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which combines `@Configuration`,
`@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations, simplifying configuration."
2. Model (Entity) Classes
Account.java
Purpose: Represents the bank account entity.
Explanation:
"The `Account` class is annotated with `@Document`, indicating it's a MongoDB document. It
contains fields like `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, `balance`, and a list of
`transactions`."
"This class maps to a MongoDB collection and represents an account in our system."
Transaction.java
Purpose: Represents a transaction entity.
Explanation:
"The `Transaction` class contains fields such as `type`, `amount`, and `timestamp`,
representing a single transaction (either deposit or withdrawal)."
3. Repository Interfaces
AccountRepository.java
Purpose: Data access layer for `Account` entities.
Explanation:
"The `AccountRepository` interface extends `MongoRepository`, providing CRUD operations
for `Account` entities."
"By using an interface, we leverage Spring Data's capability to generate the implementation
at runtime. This allows us to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code."
"It includes a custom method `findByAccountNumber` to fetch accounts by their account
number."
4. Service Classes
AccountService.java
Purpose: Contains business logic for account operations.
Explanation:
"The `AccountService` class is annotated with `@Service`, indicating it's a service
component."
"It uses the `AccountRepository` to perform operations like creating accounts, deposits,
withdrawals, fund transfers, and fetching transaction history."
"Service classes help separate business logic from controller code, promoting a cleaner
architecture and easier testing."
5. Controller Classes
AccountController.java
Purpose: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service methods.
Explanation:
"The `AccountController` class is annotated with `@RestController` and handles API
endpoints under `/api/accounts`."
"It includes endpoints for creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money,
transferring funds, checking balance, and viewing transaction history."
"Controllers handle request routing, while services perform the actual business logic."
6. Custom Exception Classes
InsufficientFundsException.java
Purpose: Custom exception for insufficient funds scenario.
Explanation:
"This exception is thrown when an account does not have enough balance to perform a
withdrawal or transfer."
AccountNotFoundException.java
Purpose: Custom exception for account not found scenario.
Explanation:
"This exception is thrown when an account with a specified number does not exist."
Explaining Interfaces vs. Normal Classes
1. Why Use Interfaces (e.g., `AccountRepository`)?
Abstraction: "Interfaces provide a way to define the contract for the data access layer
without being tied to a specific implementation."
Spring Data Integration: "By extending `MongoRepository`, we let Spring Data generate the
implementation for us, reducing boilerplate code and focusing on business logic."
Flexibility: "Interfaces allow us to easily switch implementations if needed, without
changing the service layer."
2. How It Helps:
Ease of Testing: "Using interfaces makes it easier to write unit tests by mocking
dependencies. For example, we can mock the `AccountRepository` in our tests to isolate
service logic."
Separation of Concerns: "It promotes a cleaner separation between the data access layer
and the business logic, making the codebase more modular and maintainable."
Summary
Project Structure: Organized into packages like `model`, `repository`, `service`, `controller`,
and `exception` for better modularity.
Main Class: Bootstraps the Spring Boot application.
Model Classes: Define the entities `Account` and `Transaction`.
Repository Interfaces: Extend `MongoRepository` for CRUD operations, leveraging Spring Data's
automatic implementation.
Service Classes: Contain business logic, interacting with repositories.
